    "I have always loved music, and am always on the hunt to find new songs that I would not have otherwise listened to. I decided to write an algorithm/clusterer that will provide recommendations based on songs that Spotify users have saved in the past, or belong to playlists that they have created. I expected this to be a very difficult project for me, and it was. But I was able to learn a lot, see results from my learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The below project allows a user to choose a playlist of their liking, and provide the playlist ID to the application. The application then returns the songs in that playlist that have the highest probability of being enjoyed by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially ran in to some issues with not being able to train my classifier with labels, meaning that this is truly an unsupervised learning problem. I am aware that the Udacity rubric specifies that the performance needs to be measured for my classifier. I have been able to find a metric which gives a score for the cluster's confidence for a specific recommendation that I hope is sufficient to meet this criteria. Here is the definition from the HDBSCAN API documentation of the cluster probability score: *\"The strength with which each sample is a member of its assigned cluster. Noise points have probability zero; points in clusters have values assigned proportional to the degree that they persist as part of the cluster.\"* https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html\n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to leverage the Spotify API through a Python wrapper called Spotipy to do this. In addition to this, I ran into some issues when it came to classifying new data points with an already trained DBSCAN object, so I found the HDBSCAN module which allows for the clustering of new data points."

    "I found the implementation of machine learning and the user-flow of a website to be very difficult to implement. Specifically the authentication using the Spotify API; I ran in to a lot of Django compatability issues with other libraries, and had to do a LOT of Googling. One improvement that I would suggest is adding a feature to be able to view a user's historical recommendations, and to use reinforcement learning to improve the model's performance over time by allowing a user to rate a recommendation as accurate or inaccurate. \n",

I learned a great deal about not only web development, but about programming in general that I will be sure to use at my current job and at any other future job I may have. Thank you for a great program, Udacity!\n"
